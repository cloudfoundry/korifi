                      For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                      "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered

                      index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                      referencing a part of an object.
